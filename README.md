# VOATUI
Text-based User Interface for voacapl (Python)

This is the intial version of a text-based user interface for running voacapl, the *nix/LInux version of VOACAP. The code needs some serious re-factoring.

This script requires voacapl from Jim Watson: http://www.qsl.net/hz1jw/voacapl/index.html
